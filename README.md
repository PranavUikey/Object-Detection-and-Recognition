# Object-Detection-and-Recognition
This is Object detection and recognition projet in which i have used Tensorflow api to detect the objects and recognize them.
I have used Tkinter,OpenCV libraries in the front end which it detect object in real time.It does three things for now it detects and recognizes object using tensorflow api using opencv for real time detection and save those detected labels in a file and using gtts play that file to get get audio output.Second thing is it uses video as feed and processes that video using tensorflow api and save that video with detected labels in the video in the same  folder.Third is also similar to second thing is takes image as input and saves the detected object in the image in the same folder.
You are good to go now.

If you want audio as output follow these steps:



Just overwrite the visualization_utils.py file in utils folder after removing the comments from line number 684 to 689 of this code.
And Paste the real time_video1.py in object detection folder.
